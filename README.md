# Dynamic NFT Metadata Updater

## 🧾 Project Description

**Dynamic NFT Metadata Updater** is a minimalistic smart contract system built without external libraries, allowing NFTs to be minted and updated dynamically. This enables NFTs to evolve over time with new metadata reflecting user actions, external events, or status changes.

## 🎯 Project Vision

To provide a simplified yet powerful framework for **dynamic NFTs** that evolve based on external inputs or logic. By not relying on OpenZeppelin, the contract is lightweight and educational, focusing on core logic.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧱 **No External Dependencies**: Built entirely from scratch in Solidity without OpenZeppelin.
- 🛡️ **Access Control**: Only the contract owner can mint or update NFTs.
- 🧩 **Dynamic Metadata**: Token metadata URI can be updated anytime, enabling dynamic NFT behavior.
- 🔍 **Token Tracking**: Public functions for token ownership and metadata lookup.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 🔗 **Oracle Integration**: Connect with Chainlink or similar tools to update metadata automatically.
- 👨‍💻 **Role-Based Access**: Allow specific users to mint or update metadata.
- 🎨 **On-Chain Metadata**: Store metadata or images fully on-chain for immutability.
- ⚙️ **Frontend DApp**: Provide a user-friendly interface for minting and managing dynamic NFTs.
- 🎮 **Gaming and Events**: NFTs that evolve based on in-game stats, seasonal events, or social milestones.

⚡ Ideal for developers building lightweight NFT solutions, prototyping dynamic systems, or learning core smart contract mechanics.
